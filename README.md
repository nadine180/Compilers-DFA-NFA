# Compilers-DFA-NFA

This repo contains two tasks from the Compilers Course.

In task 1, we were required to construct a DFA from a string in a particular format and test this DFA to make sure that it works properly.
In task 2, we were required to take a string representing an NFA into a dfa and then test it to see if the input strings will land in the accept state.
